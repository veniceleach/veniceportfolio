                     <h2><u>Summary of the "twelve pillars":</h2></u>"  
                         <p>Chapters 4–7 of Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener focus on self-improvement, the people we surround ourselves with, taking action, and building strong relationships.</p> 
<p> Chapter 4 explains that success isn’t something we chase, it comes naturally when we work on becoming better.</p>
<p> Chapter 5 reminds us that the people around us influence our mindset and success, so we should choose our circle wisely.</p>
<p> Chapter 6 teaches that waiting for the “perfect time” is a mistake and that we need to take action despite fear.</p>
<p>Finally, Chapter 7 emphasizes that success isn’t just about achievements but also about having strong, meaningful relationships with others.</p>

                 <h2><u>Reflection:</h2></u>
                 <p>Reading these chapters made me realize that I need to work on myself every day and not wait for the perfect moment to act.</p>
<p> I learned that true success comes from improving my skills, taking action even when I’m unsure, and surrounding myself with people who lift me up.</p>
<p> To apply this to my life, I plan to set aside time each day to read or learn something new and to stop delaying my projects because of fear or doubt.</p>
<p> I also want to be more intentional about spending time with inspiring people who motivate me to grow, and I’m going to focus on building stronger, more genuine relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.</p>
<p> This approach feels like a practical way to turn these lessons into real change in my daily life.</p>

                <h3><u>MY DEGREE:</u></h3>
                <p>As a student studying Computer Information Systems, I've learned the importance of analyzing data to extract meaningful insights and inform decision-making.</p>
<p> I've also gained an understanding of the need to protect data from unauthorized access, theft, and corruption, and have learned about various measures to mitigate these risks, such as encryption, firewalls, and access controls.</p>
<p> I recognize the responsibility that comes with handling sensitive data and understand that data breaches can have severe consequences, including financial loss and reputational damage.</p>
 <p>By studying data analysis and protection, I've gained a deeper understanding of the critical role data plays in modern organizations and the importance of ensuring its integrity, confidentiality, and availability, and I look forward to continuing my studies to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to become a competent professional in the field.</p>
